# Monte Carlo Simulation
The github repo contains a python notebook with the source code and sample_file.txt. This is the same file provided as input for the test, i have just renamed it

## Steps to Run the code
1) Open the .ipynb file in google colab (or any notebook editor of your choice)
2) Copy 'sample_file.txt' to the working directory
3) run the cells.
4) To run simulation, use 
```
run_simulations(n) # total number of simulations
```

## sample output:
Running the code for 5000 iterations multiple times, gave the similar output. so, i am convienced that 5000 iterations is giving a stable output.
